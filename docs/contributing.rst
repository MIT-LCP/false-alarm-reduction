About the documentation
-----------------------

The documentation is written in *reStructuredText*, and subsequently built
using the Python package `Sphinx <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/>`__. The Sphinx
documentation provides `a gentle introduction to
reStructuredText <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/rest.html>`__.

The documentation follows the
`NumPy Docstring Standard <https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/master/doc/HOWTO_DOCUMENT.rst.txt>`__,
which are parsed using the
`napolean extension for sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/1.5.1/ext/napoleon.html>`.

How to build the documentation
