This folder contains code which was used to generate the jqrs annotations. In order to run the code, you need:

* the peak-detector repository (www.github.com/alistairewj/peak-detector)
* the WFDB Matlab toolbox (https://github.com/ikarosilva/wfdb-app-toolbox)

You may also need to modify the paths so it locates the data properly.
